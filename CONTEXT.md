## File Location

```
/projects/aev/website/
└── index.html        ← main website file (single HTML file, no build system)
```

The entire website is a **single self-contained `index.html` file** — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all in one file. There is no framework, no bundler, no npm. Just plain HTML/CSS/JS.

The team photo (`team.jpg` or similar) should be placed in the same directory and referenced as a relative path.

## Website Structure

The site is a **one-page website** with the following sections (in order):

1. **Navigation Bar** — Logo, 3 links (Nosotros / Productos / Contacto), language switcher
2. **Hero** — Tagline, subtext, CTA buttons ("Solicitar Cotización" / "Ver Productos →")
3. **About Us (Nosotros)** — Mission, values, team photo placeholder
4. **Products & Services (Productos)** — Tabbed layout (3 tabs: Filtros Domésticos / Pre-Filtros / Servicios)
5. **Why AEV (¿Por qué elegirnos?)** — 4 benefit cards
6. **Contact (Contacto)** — Contact info + contact form

> **Note:** The Portfolio section was intentionally removed because the company is young and doesn't yet have enough completed projects to showcase.

## JavaScript Architecture

- All translations live in a `translations` object: `translations.es` and `translations.de`
- `setLang(lang)` function updates all `[data-i]` elements and `[data-placeholder]` attributes
- `filterProducts(cat)` function controls the product tab display (categories: `homefilters`, `prefilters`, `services`)
- Product cards use `data-cat` attribute to match tab filters
- Cards are shown/hidden via `.visible` CSS class

## Things Still To Do / Known Placeholders

- [x] **Team photo:** Embedded as base64 data URL directly in `index.html` (no external file dependency).
- [x] **Mobile responsiveness:** Hamburger menu at ≤800px, grids collapse at ≤900px/600px, hero fixes at ≤600px/400px. Language switcher included inside hamburger dropdown.
- [x] **Design polish:** Scroll fade-up animations (Intersection Observer), hero decorative circles, trust indicators, product card hover border, why-card hover, nav scroll shadow, footer border, typography improvements.
- [x] **Contact form:** On submit, opens WhatsApp (`wa.me/595982300202`) with name, email, subject and message pre-filled. Language-aware labels (ES/DE). Name and message are required fields.
- [ ] **Portfolio section:** Not yet added — to be considered once the company has more completed installations to showcase.
- [ ] **English language:** The `translations` object only has `es` and `de` keys. English (`en`) can be added later.
- [x] **Prices:** Intentionally omitted — site purpose is to inform and generate contact, not sell online. Pricing is discussed directly with the customer.
- [x] **Product images:** All product cards have real photos with transparent backgrounds (base64 embedded): Blue Infinity, Blue Pure, Blue Sparkling, Blue Café, Blue Ambient, Blue PreFiltro, Blue DecalSor, Canillas (ES + DE). Service cards intentionally use emoji icons.
- [x] **Product naming:** Blue PreFiltro (was PreFilter), Blue DecalSor (was Decal Sor), Canillas (was Canillas AEV). Reflected in translations (ES+DE), HTML, alt text, and image filenames.
- [x] **Spec tag translations:** All product spec tags have `data-i` keys and translate correctly in ES/DE.
- [x] **Browser tab & favicon:** Title is "Agua es Vida" (AEV removed). Blue water-drop SVG favicon added inline.
